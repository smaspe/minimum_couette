Today, to kick off a series of tutorials in sewing gears, let's have a look at the most basic item: a stuff sack.

Stuff sacks are great. You use them to sort your stuff (!) in your pack, to keep things separated, to keep some order, and also to protect your gear.

# Material needed

- Fabric
- Cord
- Cordlock
- Grosgrain or thin webbing
- A sewing machine with a buttonhole foot

# Cutting

Draw. Then cut.

# Sew the sack

Fold. Sew. Optional: sew the corners

# Add the buttonhole for the cord

I use a buttonhole for the cord because it looks good, it is stronger than leaving an opening in the final seam, and it is fairly easy

# Sew the cord channel

Position the cord and the cordlock. Fold twice. Sew the border.

# Result

Voila.
