Get to know us a little better!

# F.A.Q.

## About Minimum Couette

### Who are you?

My name is Simon. I started making my own gear some years ago with a synthetic quilt that I still occasionally use to this day. I find satisfaction in seeing good, simple, functional object come out of the sewing machine.

### Why do you do that?

Because I like it! I have been doing most of my new gear of the past few years (quilts, tents, even a jacket and a backpack)

### Are you really in Montreal?

Absolutely. The workshop is currently set in Outremont, one of Montreal's district, right at the edge of the Plateau.

### Minimum Couette, what does that even mean?

Couette is French for Quilt. One of the key feature of the gear I design is minimalism. Weight is always an important factor in hiking, and I find that simplicity of use and maintenance is as well.

## About the making of outdoor gear

### How do you design your gear?

I look a lot at what other people do, at what DIYers do, and at what I dislike about the gear I see or use. Then I try to find a better way of doing it, or to solve a particular issue I find.

I always design my gear for myself first, so that I am entirely satisfied with how it works before showing it to anyone.

### How do you test it?

How do you think? I take it in real life, and I see how it behaves. For quilts, I take a thermometer, to verify the rating is as I expect. As much as possible I have other people testing the gear as well.

## About the Materials

### Why do you insist on Canadian Down?

Down is a sensitive material. Downs from unknown origins are sometime live-plucked, which is unacceptable. So I insist on tracability of the material. And Canada has some of the world's best ducks! Also, I find it makes more sense to source materials as close as possible, to avoid unnecessary transport.

### 800 cu.in. what is that?

`cu.in.`, or cubic inches, is short for *cubic inches per once*. It represent the volume occupied by 1 once of down under specific testing conditions. (TODO link to how that is measured).

800 cu.in. is high quality down. It is also possible to find up to 900 (some even claim 1000) cu.in. but at much higher prices.

### What are those fabrics you use?

Most fabrics are either nylon or polyester. For quilts, I use ultra-light fabrics, weighting between 0.67 and 1.1
