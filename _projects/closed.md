The simplest model. Just lay it on your sleeping pad, and it is ready. With no zipper, the head cord is the only moving part.

It has a closed, fully baffled 50cm (20") footbox for maximum warmth.

Like the [zippered model]({% site.url %}/products/flat.html), it can attach to your sleeping pad using the same straps and clips.

The head cinches to keep the warmth inside.
