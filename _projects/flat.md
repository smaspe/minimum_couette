This quilt has a zippered footbox. You can spread it flat like a blanket for more comfort. You can also close the footbox with the 50cm (20") zip for more warmth.

Like the [closed model]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/closed.html), it can attach to your sleeping pad using the same straps and clips.

The head cinches to keep the warmth inside.
