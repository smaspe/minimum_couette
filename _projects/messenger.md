A large messenger bag to carry _all_ your stuff around. It contains a lot, but fits perfectly on the back without hampering your movement.

Made of thick and durable fabric, it is fully waterproof. The large lid prevents any water projection from reaching the inside of the bag.

Because you have a lot to carry, it includes  a laptop pocket, a document pocket on the lid, a key pocket in the main compartment, a lock pocket under the lid, and a large main pocket.

The wide strap is made of 5cm (2") safety belt webbing, padded on the shoulder. It can be reversed for left or right shoulder, and the bag is stabilized on your back by a removable under-arm strap.
